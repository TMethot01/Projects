# Projects
Repository for fun projects.

These probably aren't all completely fleshed out projects and I mostly only spend a day or two on them just to learn the libraries and 
get some experience with the tech. 

If anyone wants some edits on these or any details let me know, but since they're mostly useless projects I don't bother to polish them up all that much.
